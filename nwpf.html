        <h3>Satyajit Rayâ€™s genius spans all possible genres of art and literature, and Professor Shonku is proof of
            that. </h3>
        <p>Professor Shonku is a
            genius scientist with some of the coolest inventions under his belt. From Air-conditioning pills , that keep
            the body temperature normal in extremes of climate and Fishpill, which is space food for cats, he also has
            his very own Frankenstein Formula to bring back the dead. Not only does he speak 69 languages, he also has a
            24-year-old cat named Newton! Yes, he is very very cool. Fangirl forever.</p>
